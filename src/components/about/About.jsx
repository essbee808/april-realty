            I became a real estate agent because I want to help people make informed decisions regarding
            their property--whether it's buying or selling. My purpose in life has always been to serve
            others. As an attorney, I help clients navigate through the legal system. As an adjunct professor,
            I help students prepare for the "real world." Regardless of what hat I'm wearing, the most important
            thing to me is helping others succeed and reach their goals. I strive to provide the best service
            so that you can have the best experience.
